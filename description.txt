Title: YAMA (Yet Another Moderator Addon)
Author: Dominoes, code snippets from Moderator v2 by Tezuni, DarkLight and Munk
Module loading! Playerlist updating! YAMA.

==== Overview ====

Introduction
-
Introducing YAMA! Yet Another Moderator Addon is a moderator add-on seen in the eyes of Dominoes, with introductions of lots of new features. This includes updating the playerlist with one's status. moderator orbing and fetch/finding, and even module loading.

Module Loading
-
No more having to hassle with adding lines of code to load new modules or using separate add-ons with moderator-supported scripts. With YAMA, you can simply drag all your custom moderator-supported scripts into the included "modules" folder, and simply reload your server or re-execute the add-on with "exec("Add-Ons/Server_YAMA/server.cs");" without quotations. With that, your new modules will be loaded instantly and will be ready for use.

Player List Labeling
-
Confused with who's a moderator? Worry no more, as Blockland Glass's 'Glass_setPlayerListStatus' function can update the playerlist with any letter one wants. Admins and other users can tell who's a moderator and who isn't.

Admin Tools, now functioning with moderators
-
Moderators can now use the admin orb, alongside /warp, /fetch, and /find. Everyone gets notified when admins and moderators use either /fetch or /find, so people can determine who's cheating in games and who isn't.

Auto-Or-Manual Moderator
-
Don't want someone to become a moderator when they rejoin? Don't fret, as one can make someone a manual moderator, and loses the status when they rejoin. Or, simply put "a" after the /mod command and you'll make them an automatic moderator.

==== Base Commands ====

/mod victim type
Rank required: Super Admin/Admin, depends on pref set

==== How to make your own modules ====

So you want to make your own modules and have them loaded with this add-on. That's cool!
However, you'll need a few things in your script before you think about letting it load:
== Moderator Checks ==
Make sure the add-on actually has support for moderators. That means adding checks such as "if(%client.isModerator)" in your script. Without this it sorta becomes useless and unneeded.
== Help Function ==
Ensure you have a function stated in your script that shows information about it. YAMA will say that there's no information found if your script doesn't explicitly state anything about it. Look in other modules to see how it works.
== Make sure it works ==
Nothing's worse than a broken script. Ensure that it works before letting others use it. Not much else to say.
Once you've done/added the prerequestites, drag your script into the modules folder in the add-on. You'll be all set!
